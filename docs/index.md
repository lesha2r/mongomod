## Why MongoMod?

MongoMod is a feature-rich MongoDB ODM (Object Document Mapper) that provides an intuitive, model-based approach to working with MongoDB databases. It combines the flexibility of MongoDB with the structure and safety of schema validation, custom methods, and event-driven programming.

## Quick Example

```javascript
import mongomod from 'mongomod';

// Create connection
const db = new mongomod.Connection({
    link: 'localhost:27017',
    dbName: 'myapp'
});
await db.connect();

// Define schema
const userSchema = new mongomod.Schema({
    name: { type: String, required: true },
    email: { type: String, required: true },
    age: { type: Number }
});

// Create model with custom methods
const User = mongomod.createModel({
    db: db,
    collection: 'users',
    schema: userSchema,
    customs: {
        getFullInfo() {
            return `${this.data().name} (${this.data().email})`;
        }
    }
});

// Use the model
const user = new User().init({
    name: 'John Doe',
    email: 'john@example.com',
    age: 25
});

await user.save(true);
console.log(user.getFullInfo()); // "John Doe (john@example.com)"
```

## Installation

```bash
npm install mongomod
```
